# Welcome to ACW (Another Crossplane Workshop)

![Crossplane](assets/images/crossplane-banner.png)

[Crossplane](https://crossplane.io/) is an open source [Cloud Native Compute Foundation](https://www.cncf.io/) project that transforms a [Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io/) cluster into a universal control plane.

In this workshop, you will be able to learn what Crossplane is and why is so disruptive.

## Goals

The goals of this workshop are:

- What is Crossplane and some of its features.
- Install and test it in your local Kubernetes.
