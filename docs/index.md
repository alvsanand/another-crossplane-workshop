# APIfy your infra with Crossplane

![Crossplane](assets/images/crossplane-banner.png)

[Crossplane](https://crossplane.io/) is an open source [Cloud Native Compute Foundation](https://www.cncf.io/) project that transforms a [Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io/) cluster into a universal control plane.

In this workshop, you will be able to learn how to create an API to deploy your infrastructure using Crossplane.

## Goals

The goals of this workshop are:

- Know what is Crossplane and some of its great features.
- Install and use it in your local Kubernetes without any costs.
- Deploy "real" infrastructure with a couple of commands.
- Create your own API using custom composite resources and packages.
- Integrate your infrastructure in a Continuos Delivery pipeline.
